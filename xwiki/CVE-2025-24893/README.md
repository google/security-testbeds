To build and start a vulnerable XWiki instance:
```sh
docker build --build-arg XWIKI_VERSION=15.10.10 --build-arg JAVA_VERSION=11 -t xwiki:15.10.10 .
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 --name xwiki -it xwiki:15.10.10
```

To build and start a patched XWiki instance:
```sh
docker build --build-arg XWIKI_VERSION=17.4.3 -t xwiki:17.4.3 .
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 --name xwiki -it xwiki:17.4.3
```

By default, the script xwiki-init.py is executed (see end of Dockerfile) and automates the following installation steps :
- Wait that XWiki / Jetty starts
- Connect to http://<IP>:8080/xwiki
- Click on "Continue"
- Fulfill the form to create the admin account, then click on "Continue" after the success message is displayed
- Select the Flavor "XWiki Standard Flavor". The page may need to be reloaded if it does not display directly
- Click on "Continue" to continue with the installation process
- When XWiki is successfully set up, you will be redirected from `/bin/distribution/XWiki/Distribution` to `/bin/view/Main/`
