# Webmin Unauthenticated Remote Code Execution (CVE-2019-15107)
CVE-2019-15107 is a vulnerability in Webmin versions 1.890 to 1.920 that allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands as root. The vulnerability is due to the way Webmin handles user input in the password change form. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted HTTP request to the Webmin server. This allows the attacker to execute arbitrary commands as root on the affected system.

## Docker-compose
You can deploy the vulnerable version of Webmin by running in docker-compose:
```sh
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up
```
It takes several minutes to wait for the service to be accessed normally, and the exposed web service port is [10000].

## Kubernetes
Or you can deploy the vulnerable version of Webmin by running in Kubernetes:
```sh
kubectl apply -f webmin-cve-2019-15107.yaml
```
The Kubernetes deployment will create a service named `webmin-cve-2019-15107` listening on port `10000`.
