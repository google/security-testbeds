# MLflow CVE-2023-1177

mlflow is a platform to streamline machine learning development, including tracking experiments, packaging code into reproducible runs, and sharing and deploying models. Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Improper Access Control which enables malicious actors to download arbitrary files unrelated to MLflow from the host server, including any files stored in remote locations to which the host server has access.

```sh
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up
```

It takes several minutes to wait for the service to be accessed normally, and the exposed web service port is [15000].
