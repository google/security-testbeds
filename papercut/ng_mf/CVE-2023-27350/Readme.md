# PaperCut NF/MF Docker images

---

### Setup

There are two different methods that can be used to build the dockerfile images.

Both are to be ran from the same directory that the `readme.md` is located in

1. Using `local_builder.sh` (slow, but reliable)
  - Run `chmod +x local_builder.sh`, then `./local_builder.sh`

2. Using `docker-bake.hcl` (recommended, faster)
  -  Run `docker buildx bake`

#### Using the images

Run the command `docker run -it --rm -p 80:80 papercut_ng_mf:<version>` (see below for the available versions)

> Note: The `-it` command is not necessary, but it does show the output for the container, aiding in troubleshooting
