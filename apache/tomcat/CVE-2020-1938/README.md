# Ghostcat (CVE-2020-1938)

This directory contains the deployment config for a default Tomcat application.
Based on the provided version, the application might have an exposed AJP
connector and therefore be vulnerable to Ghostcat.

The deployed service has name `tomcat` and listens on port `8009` (AJP Connector
port).

**Note:** Change Tomcat version in [Template data](#template-data) according to
which version you want to test. Below are the versions that are vulnerable to
Ghostcat:

**Apache Version**|**Affected Release Versions**|**Fixed Version**
:-----:|:-----:|:-----:
Apache Tomcat 9|9.0.30 and below|9.0.31
Apache Tomcat 8|8.5.50 and below|8.5.51
Apache Tomcat 7|7.0.99 and below|7.0.100

## Template data

```json
{
  "tomcat_version": "8.5.32"
}
```
