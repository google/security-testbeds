# Apache ActiveMQ CVE-2023-46604

Apache ActiveMQ is vulnerable to Remote Code Execution.The vulnerability may allow a remote attacker with network access to a broker to run arbitrary shell commands by manipulating serialized class types in the OpenWire protocol to cause the broker to instantiate any class on the classpath.

## Docker-compose
You can deploy the vulnerable version of Apache ActiveMQ by running in docker-compose:
```sh
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up
```
It takes several minutes to wait for the service to be accessed normally, and the exposed web service port is [8161],tcp port is [61616]. but the vulnerability is only exposed on port 61616.

## Kubernetes
Or you can deploy the vulnerable version of Apache ActiveMQ by running in kubernetes:
```sh
kubectl apply -f apache-activemq-cve-2023-46604.yaml
```
The Kubernetes deployment will create a service named `apache-activemq-cve-2023-46604` listening on port `61616`.
