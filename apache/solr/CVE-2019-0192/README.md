# Apache Solr CVE-2019-0192

This README contains instruction to deploy Docker images required to verify CVE-2019-0192

## Vulnerable setup

`docker compose -f vuln-docker-compose.yml up`

### Steps to Reproduce

In order to manually verify the issue, you can follow the steps below

1. Setup a `netcat` listener on a server with a public IP. This can be done via `nc -lnvp PORT`
2. Run the Python script by providing the fields accordingly: `python3 exp.py TARGET-URL YOUR-SERVER-IP YOUR-SERVER-PORT`
3. Notice that you have received a pingback to your public listener
4. This hints that you have configured Apache Solr to use your server.

## Safe setup

`docker compose -f safe-docker-compose.yml up`

In this case, by following the steps to reproduce, you will not receive any pingback to your server.
