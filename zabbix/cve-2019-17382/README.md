# CVE-2019-17382
An issue was discovered in zabbix.php?action=dashboard.view&dashboardid=1 in Zabbix through 4.4. An attacker can bypass the login page and access the dashboard page, and then create a Dashboard, Report, Screen, or Map without any Username/Password (i.e., anonymously). All created elements (Dashboard/Report/Screen/Map) are accessible by other users and by an admin.

## Docker-compose
You can deploy the vulnerable version of Zabbix by running in docker-compose:
```sh
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up
```
It takes several minutes to wait for the service to be accessed normally, and the exposed web service port is [23820].

## Kubernetes
Or you can deploy the vulnerable version of Zabbix by running in Kubernetes:
```sh
kubectl apply -f zabbix-cve-2019-17382.yaml
```
The Kubernetes deployment will create a service named `zabbix-cve-2019-17382` listening on port `23820`.
