# WordPress Theme Workreap 2.2.2 - Unauthenticated Upload Leading to Remote Code Execution (CVE-2021-24499)

The Workreap WordPress theme version prior to 2.2.2 is plagued by a lack of nonce checks and user validation, enabling unauthenticated users to upload arbitrary files with malicious executable code.
The AJAX actions workreap_award_temp_file_uploader and workreap_temp_file_uploader did not perform nonce checks, or validate that the request is from a valid user in any other way. The endpoints allowed for uploading arbitrary files to the uploads/workreap-temp directory. Uploaded files were neither sanitized nor validated, allowing an unauthenticated visitor to upload executable code such as php scripts.



# Docker-compose

You can deploy the vulnerable version of WordPress Plugin DZS Zoomsounds by running in docker-compose:
```
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up
```
It takes several minutes to wait for the service to be accessed normally, and the exposed web service port is [8080].
