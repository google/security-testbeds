# LlamaFactory CVE-2024-52803 - OS Command Injection

This testbed contains both vulnerable and patched versions of LlamaFactory to demonstrate CVE-2024-52803, a critical OS command injection vulnerability.

### Description

LlamaFactory is vulnerable to remote OS command injection through the `output_dir` parameter in the training process. The vulnerability arises from improper handling of user input where the `output_dir` value is passed unsanitized to Python's `Popen()` function with `shell=True`, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary OS commands.


## Setup

- Run Vulnerable Version Only

```bash
docker-compose up llama-factory-vulnerable
```

The vulnerable instance will be available at **http://localhost:7860**

- Run Safe/Patched Version Only

```bash
docker-compose up llama-factory-safe
```

The patched instance will be available at **http://localhost:7861**

- Run Both Versions Simultaneously

```bash
docker-compose up
```

- **Vulnerable**: http://localhost:7860
- **Safe**: http://localhost:7861

Both services take 1-2 minutes to initialize. Wait for the log message:

```
Running on local URL:  http://0.0.0.0:7860
```

## Reproduce

The PoC uses the Gradio queue endpoints `/queue/join` and `/queue/data`.
Reference PoC: https://gist.github.com/superboy-zjc/f2d2b93ae511c445ba97e144b70e534d

```sh
uv run poc_verify.py --url http://localhost:7860 --cmd "echo poc-vuln"
```

Run the PoC against the vulnerable instance and confirm command execution (log output). Then repeat against the safe instance and confirm there is no command output.
