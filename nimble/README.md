# OSV-Scalibr: Nimble Extractor

This directory contains the test Dockerfile for testing OSV-Scalibr Nimble Extractor plugin. Nimble is the package manager for modules written in Nim language. Nimble stores the metadata of installed packages under ~/.nimble/pkgs2 (or ~/.nimble/pkgs for older Nimble versions), with each packageâ€™s .nimble file located in its corresponding subdirectory. This plugin enumerates these paths to read .nimble files to extract packagename and version of installed packages.

## Setup

```sh
docker build -t nimble-test .
docker run -it --rm -v $(pwd):/app nimble-test (to put scalibr binary inside the container)
```
