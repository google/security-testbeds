# MCP Inspector CVE-2025-49596 

This directory contains the deployment config for MCP Inspector instances vulnerable and fixed to CVE-2025-49596. MCP Inspector versions below 0.14.1 are vulnerable to that remote code execution vulnerability.

## How to Trigger the Vulnerability?

To trigger the vulnerability, you can use the following provided Python Script called inspectorExp.py. After the docker setup, provided script will send the related GET request. In a vulnerable environment, after the Python script, you can see the created file named tsunami under the /tmp/ directory of the running container.

Python code:

```sh
# Run above Python script to trigger the file creation.
python inspectorExp.py
```

In case you cannot trigger the vulnerability, you might need to delete your existing container images because Docker might try to reuse them.

```sh
sudo docker rmi -f $(sudo docker images -aq)
sudo docker remove $(sudo docker ps -a -q)
```


## Fixed version
```sh
git clone https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/inspector.git
cd inspector && git checkout 0.16.3
cp ../Dockerfile .
docker build --tag inspector-fixed .
docker run --network host inspector-fixed 
```

The vulnerability-related service listens on `localhost:6277` after the docker completes its job.

## Vulnerable version
```sh
git clone https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/inspector.git
cd inspector && git checkout 0.14.0
cp ../Dockerfile .
docker build --tag inspector-vuln .
docker run --network host inspector-vuln 
```

The vulnerability-related service listens on `localhost:6277` after the docker completes its job.
