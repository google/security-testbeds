# DocsGPT CVE-2025-0868

This directory contains the deployment config for DocsGPT instances vulnerable and fixed to CVE-2025-0868. DocsGPT versions between 0.8.1 and 0.12.0 are vulnerable to that remote code execution vulnerability.

## How to Trigger the Vulnerability?

To trigger the vulnerability, you can use the following provided Python Script called docsGPTExp.py. After the docker setup, provided script will send the related POST request. In a vulnerable environment, after the Python script, you can see the created file named tsunami under the /tmp/ directory.

Curl Requests:

```sh
# Run above Python script to trigger the file creation.
python docsGPTExp.py
```

In case you cannot trigger the vulnerability, you might need to delete your existing container images because Docker might try to reuse them.

```sh
sudo docker rmi -f $(sudo docker images -aq)
sudo docker remove $(sudo docker ps -a -q)
```

  
## Fixed version
```sh
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh fixed
```

The related service component which is the worker container listens on `localhost:7091` after the docker completes its job.

## Vulnerable version
```sh
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh vuln
```

The related service component which is the worker container listens on `localhost:7091` after the docker completes its job.
